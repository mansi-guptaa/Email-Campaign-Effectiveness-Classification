# Email-Campaign-Effectiveness-Prediction


## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to evaluate the effectiveness of email campaigns for small to medium businesses (SMBs). The objective is to classify emails into three categories—Ignored, Read, or Acknowledged—allowing businesses to optimize their email strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project comprises various email features, including:

- Email Type
- Subject Hotness Score
- Source
- Campaign Type
- Customer Location
- Time Sent
- Word Count
- Number of Links
- Number of Images
- Email Status (Target Variable)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Wrangling**:
   - Address missing values in features such as 'Customer_Location', 'Total_Past_Communications', 'Total_Links', and 'Total_Images'.
   - Use statistical techniques like Cramer's V to assess feature relevance and potentially drop less impactful features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover patterns and relationships between variables.
   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to gain insights and communicate findings.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Develop new features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.

4. **Model Selection and Development**:
   - Evaluate various machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, including:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost)

5. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**:
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Optimize model parameters using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (e.g., RandomizedSearchCV).

6. **Deployment**:
   - Prepare the model for deployment using libraries like `joblib` to enable real-time predictions.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical solution for SMBs to enhance their email marketing effectiveness and achieve improved business outcomes. By classifying emails into meaningful categories, businesses can refine their email strategies and increase customer engagement.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `joblib`, etc.
